# jwtauthdemo
A python demo of how to receive authorization from an OAuth server via jwt

## Prerequisites
* This script requires the python requests module, which can be installed via pip/pip3 install requests
* This script assumes that you have OAuth2 server with the ability to set up clients
* You will need to generate a public/private keypair to use for authentication
    * The public key needs to be registered on the OAuth2 server and associated with the ClientID
    * The private key must be accessible by this script, and in the pem format

## Before running
Before running the script, the parameters in the header must be populated:
* ClientID - This is the ClientID assigned/registered with the OAuth2 server
* TokenEndpoint - the URL for the OAuth2 server token endpoint (usually ends with /oauth2/token)
* TargetFHIREndpoint - The resource that the token will be used to access.  This assumes a FHIR use case, but can technically be used for any REST endpoint
* some-privatekey.pem - The location of the private key used to encode the JWT

## Running the script
If everything goes well, the script should print the access token generated by the OAuth2 server.

If the token is not printed, you may need to uncomment the print statement towards the end of getBearerToken to diagnose the issue.
